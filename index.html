                    Hello! If you want to know more about me, then keep reading.
                    Otherwise, feel free to hit that back button or close your
                    browser. You have been warned...

                    My name is Brandt Strom, but considering the large header on
                    this page you probably already knew that. What you probably
                    do NOT know, is that I am a 29 year old Norwegian strawberry
                    currently living is Redmond, WA. My wife, Rachel, and I have
                    lived in the same two bedroom apartment for about 4 years
                    now. We hope to own a home some day, but the important
                    details of 'where' and 'when' are still unknown at this
                    time.

                    My history is not very exciting but I don't have any
                    complaints. I have two sisters and spent most of my
                    childhood living in Puyallup. I spent a lot of time getting
                    into trouble with friends and playing video games. Soccer
                    consumed many evenings and weekends, and I still enjoy
                    kicking a ball around to this day. After graduating from
                    high school, I moved to Ellensburg for 4 years
                    where I attended Central Washington University. It was there
                    that I obtained a degree in Computer Science, which allowed
                    me to secure a software development position in Redmond. I have been a software engineer for almost
                    7 years now and I am excited to keep growing in this field.

                    When I'm looking for something to do in my spare time, I
                    usually enjoy playing video games and catching up with
                    friends. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies
                    with Rachel. When my neighbors are not home I will
                    occasionally use the opportunity to mess around on my drum
                    set. Additionally, I try to make an effort to expand my
                    knowledge on all things computers and technology by watching
                    videos and reading blogs and articles.
